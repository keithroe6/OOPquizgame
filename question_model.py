# Step 1: Create a question model (Class) 

# Create a class that can be used as a constructor to build new questions

class Question:
    # Use the __init__dunder method to indicate the function is a constructor 
    # Set up 2 attributes for the question text and answer
    def __init__(self, q_text, q_answer):
        # Be sure to use the self syntax to be able to refer back to the object to access the attributes later
        self.text = q_text
        self.answer = q_answer
# Test to make sure it is functioning properly
# new_q = Question('Are you ready for this quiz?', "False")
# print(new_q)
